# Albelli test

This repository contains a basic setup for a JavaScript project.
See "_System requirements_" below to get up
and running! The "_Project outline_" section walks you through a basic
rundown of the structure.

## Project outline

The entry point for your JavaScript application is _./src/app/js/main.js_. The build script
will ensure these get automatically built for use in your browser.

The project uses SASS as a preprocessor for writing your styles (though you can
write regular CSS inside a .scss file if you would like to). If you choose to use CSS,
you can use _./src/app/css/main.scss_ as your entry point SASS file.

Using `npm run build` all build output will be stored in the _./dist_ folder, this is
automatically generated by the build script and its contents can be ignored.

## System requirements

In order to build the project you will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

In the root of this repository, you can resolve all these dependencies via
the command line using:

    npm install

You can now start developing the application using Webpack by typing:

    npm start

You can now start tests using Webpack by typing:

    npm test
